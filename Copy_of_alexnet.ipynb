        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Missing Ingredient - Hardware\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep learning models are voracious consumers of compute cycles.\n",
        "Training can take hundreds of epochs, and each iteration\n",
        "requires passing data through many layers of computationally-expensive\n",

        "graphics processing to benefit computer games.\n",
        "In particular, they were optimized for high throughput 4x4 matrix-vector products, which are needed for many computer graphics tasks.\n",
        "Fortunately, this math is strikingly similar\n",
        "to that required to calculate convolutional layers.\n",
        "Around that time, NVIDIA and ATI had begun optimizing GPUs\n",
        "for general compute operations,\n",
        "going as far as to market them as General Purpose GPUs (GPGPU).\n",
        "\n",
        "To provide some intuition, consider the cores of a modern microprocessor\n",
        "(CPU).\n",
        "Each of the cores is fairly powerful running at a high clock frequency\n",

        "Each core is well-suited to executing a wide range of instructions,\n",
        "with branch predictors, a deep pipeline, and other bells and whistles\n",
        "that enable it to run a large variety of programs.\n",
        "This apparent strength, however, is also its Achilles heel:\n",

        "Modern laptops have up to 4 cores,\n",
        "and even high end servers rarely exceed 64 cores,\n",
        "simply because it is not cost effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "By comparison, GPUs consist of 100-1000 small processing elements\n",
        "(the details differ somewhat between NVIDIA, ATI, ARM and other chip vendors),\n",
        "often grouped into larger groups (NVIDIA calls them warps).\n",
        "While each core is relatively weak,\n",
        "sometimes even running at sub-1GHz clock frequency,\n",
        "it is the total number of such cores that makes GPUs orders of magnitude faster than CPUs.\n",
        "For instance, NVIDIA's latest Volta generation offers up to 120 TFlops per chip for specialized instructions\n",
        "(and up to 24 TFlops for more general purpose ones),\n",
        "while floating point performance of CPUs has not exceeded 1 TFlop to date.\n",
        "The reason for why this is possible is actually quite simple:\n",
        "first, power consumption tends to grow *quadratically* with clock frequency.\n",
        "Hence, for the power budget of a CPU core that runs 4x faster (a typical number),\n",
        "you can use 16 GPU cores at 1/4 the speed,\n",
        "which yields 16 x 1/4 = 4x the performance.\n",

        "to execute general purpose code),\n",
        "which makes them more energy efficient.\n",
        "Last, many operations in deep learning require high memory bandwidth.\n",
        "Again, GPUs shine here with buses that are at least 10x as wide as many CPUs.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The design philosophies of AlexNet and LeNet are very similar,\n",
        "but there are also significant differences.\n",
        "First, AlexNet is much deeper than the comparatively small LeNet5.\n",
        "AlexNet consists of eight layers: five convolutional layers,\n",
        "two fully-connected hidden layers, and one fully-connected output layer. Second, AlexNet used the ReLU instead of the sigmoid\n",
        "as its activation function.\n",
        "Let us delve into the details below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "In AlexNet's first layer, the convolution window shape is $11\\times11$.\n",
        "Since most images in ImageNet are more than ten times higher and wider\n",
        "than the MNIST images,\n",
        "objects in ImageNet data tend to occupy more pixels.\n",
        "Consequently, a larger convolution window is needed to capture the object.\n",
        "The convolution window shape in the second layer\n",
        "is reduced to $5\\times5$, followed by $3\\times3$.\n",
        "In addition, after the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers,\n",
        "the network adds maximum pooling layers\n",
        "with a window shape of $3\\times3$ and a stride of 2.\n",
        "Moreover, AlexNet has ten times more convolution channels than LeNet.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the last convolutional layer are two fully-connected layers\n",
        "with 4096 outputs.\n",
        "These two huge fully-connected layers produce model parameters of nearly 1 GB.\n",
        "Due to the limited memory in early GPUs,\n",
        "the original AlexNet used a dual data stream design,\n",
        "so that each of their two GPUs could be responsible\n",
        "for storing and computing only its half of the model.\n",
        "Fortunately, GPU memory is comparatively abundant now,\n",
        "so we rarely need to break up models across GPUs these days\n",
        "(our version of the AlexNet model deviates\n",
        "from the original paper in this aspect).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Activation Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, AlexNet changed the sigmoid activation function to a simpler ReLU activation function. On the one hand, the computation of the ReLU activation function is simpler. For example, it does not have the exponentiation operation found in the sigmoid activation function.\n",
        " On the other hand, the ReLU activation function makes model training easier when using different parameter initialization methods. This is because, when the output of the sigmoid activation function is very close to 0 or 1, the gradient of these regions is almost 0, so that back propagation cannot continue to update some of the model parameters. In contrast, the gradient of the ReLU activation function in the positive interval is always 1. Therefore, if the model parameters are not properly initialized, the sigmoid function may obtain a gradient of almost 0 in the positive interval, so that the model cannot be effectively trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Capacity Control and Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "AlexNet controls the model complexity of the fully-connected layer\n",
        "by dropout (:numref:`sec_dropout`),\n",
        "while LeNet only uses weight decay.\n",
        "To augment the data even further, the training loop of AlexNet\n",
        "added a great deal of image augmentation,\n",
        "such as flipping, clipping, and color changes.\n",
        "This makes the model more robust and the larger sample size effectively reduces overfitting.\n",
        "We will discuss data augmentation in greater detail in :numref:`sec_image_augmentation`."

        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "* AlexNet has a similar structure to that of LeNet, but uses more convolutional layers and a larger parameter space to fit the large-scale dataset ImageNet.\n",
        "* Today AlexNet has been surpassed by much more effective architectures but it is a key step from shallow to deep networks that are used nowadays.\n",
        "* Although it seems that there are only a few more lines in AlexNet's implementation than in LeNet, it took the academic community many years to embrace this conceptual change and take advantage of its excellent experimental results. This was also due to the lack of efficient computational tools.\n",
        "* Dropout, ReLU and preprocessing were the other key steps in achieving excellent performance in computer vision tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Exercises\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Try increasing the number of epochs. Compared with LeNet, how are the results different? Why?\n",
        "1. AlexNet may be too complex for the Fashion-MNIST dataset.\n",
        "    * Try to simplify the model to make the training faster, while ensuring that the accuracy does not drop significantly.\n",
        "    * Can you design a better model that works directly on $28 \\times 28$ images.\n",
        "1. Modify the batch size, and observe the changes in accuracy and GPU memory.\n",
        "1. Rooflines:\n",
        "    * What is the dominant part for the memory footprint of AlexNet?\n",
        "    * What is the dominant part for computation in AlexNet?\n",
        "    * How about memory bandwidth when computing the results?\n",
        "1. Apply dropout and ReLU to LeNet5. Does it improve? How about preprocessing?\n",
